    <h2>Food Pairings:</h2>
    <p>If you keep spice and flavor intensity slightly lower while accentuating creamy, buttery flavors and textures you will be delighted. This is a wine worthy of lobster.</p>

    <h2>Buttery Chardonnay</h2>
    <p>Oaked Chardonnays are rich, full-bodied and have additional flavors of vanilla, butter and even caramel from the oak. A cool climate, buttery Chardonnay will have more citrus flavors versus a warm climate Chardonnay, which will have more tropical fruit flavors.</p>

    <h2>Unoaked Chardonnay</h2>
    <p>Unoaked Chardonnay is far closer to the zesty style of Pinot Gris or Sauvignon Blanc. Chardonnay wine tends to have less ‘green flavors’ than Sauvignon Blanc. Depending on how ripe the grapes were when picked, the flavor ranges from lemon and green apple (less ripe) to pineapple and figs (very ripe).</p>

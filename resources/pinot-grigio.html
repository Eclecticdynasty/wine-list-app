    <h3>Minerally & Dry</h3>
    <p>This style is most famous from the northern parts of Italy and traverses the foothills of the Alps nearly all the way from Italy through Austria and even Romania, Slovenia and Hungary.</p>
    <h3>Fruity & Dry</h3>
    <p>Winemakers often choose the word Pinot Gris to describe this fruit-driven style of Pinot Gris. Youâ€™ll be able to pick out lemon, yellow apple and white peach among the flavors that you smell. This presence of more fruit in the aroma tells us that these wines grew in a more sun-friendly climate. </p>
    <h3>Fruity & Sweet</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the only place in the world that makes a quality sweeter-style Pinot Gris is Alsace, France. </p>

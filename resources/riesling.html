    <h2>How to Find a Dry Riesling</h2>
    <p>When looking for a drier style Riesling, look for one with moderate levels of alcohol (e.g. 11% ABV and above). An ABV of 9%, for example, usually indicates that not all the sugars were converting into alcohol, leaving some leftover in the form of residual sugar.</p>

    <h2>Regional Taste Differences</h2>

    <h3>New Zealand</h3>
    <p>It’s the unmistakable aromas of passion fruit (and sometimes verging on jalapeño) that make Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand so distinct. In fact, it’s the country’s most planted grape variety, which says a lot about how much New Zealanders appreciate white wine. </p>

    <h3>Loire Valley, France</h3>
    <p>French wines drop the varietal name (Sauvignon Blanc) and adopt the name of the village on the label. So when you buy a Sancerre (san-sare), a Pouilly-Fumé (poo-yee fume-aye), a Cheverny, or a Touraine, you are essentially drinking Sauvignon Blanc from the Loire. These Sauvignon Blanc wines are considered some of the best in the world and are known for their more herbaceous, lime-driven and grassy style.</p>
    
    <h3>North Coast of California</h3>
    <p>We know Napa and Sonoma for Cabernet and Chardonnay, but the North Coast also produces outstanding Sauvignon Blanc. Most of these wines experience some time in oak which increases the unctuous, oily rich quality on the palate. Flavors are more pure in fruit with nectarine, white peach and Meyer lemon zest, without the herbal-grassy notes common in all the other regions. </p>

    <h2>Region Taste Differences</h2>
    <p>Zinfandel is an immigrant like most Americans. Cuttings from the imperial gardens at Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna were brought to Boston hothouses in the 1820’s. </p>

    <h3>Amador County and the Sierra Foothills</h3>
    <p>Amador County produces the most jammy Zinfandels on the market. Flavors of raspberries and super ripe strawberries are dominant. Zinfandels from this area tend to be less spicey and rich with high alcohol content. </p>

    <h3>Lodi (Central Valley, Modesto)</h3>
    <p>A large flat region in the central valley, Lodi is a major commercial winery area in California. Despite the homogeny of large commercial production, Zinfandels from Lodi typically have rich dark raspberry to mocha flavors followed by a smokey maple finish. </p>
    
    <h3>Napa Valley</h3>
    <p>Of the remaining Zinfandel in the area, the wines are highly aromatic with notes of blackberry and black pepper. The wines typically exhibit both higher acidity and higher tannins which in turn makes them age-worthy.</p>

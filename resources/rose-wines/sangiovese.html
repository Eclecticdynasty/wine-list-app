    <h2>Food Pairings</h2>
    <p>Sangiovese is bold enough as a variety to handle a variety of foods that normally would be problematic to pair with wine. The ros√© will pair wonderfully with rich Chinese food dishes, Thai Curries and, of course, Italian favorites such as caprese salad and prosciutto.</p>
